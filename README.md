Team Go Software Design Principles Test, by Eduard Carreras

## Getting Started

This project is an exercise for Team Go Software.

It displays a feed of activities, randomly generated on the class MockData.
This class creates random users based on the UInames API (https://uinames.com/)
and then generates some random activities to fill the feed.

By clicking an activity card you can view a detail screen for the activity.

It also allows to add new activities and edit the activities created by the user.

Activities are not stored anywhere, so each time the app starts again a new set of random activities is created.
